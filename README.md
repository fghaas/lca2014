This presentation uses
[reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) with a custom
theme, with [shellinabox](http://code.google.com/p/shellinabox/) for
terminal emulation.

The terminal emulation parts **will not work** unless you have working
machines or VMs that you can connect to, with corresponding
shellinabox daemon. The demo setup is not included in this repo.
